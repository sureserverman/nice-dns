## About

> This is docker-compose file and all necessary files to build multi-container application with pi-hole, unbound and socat with tor
> chained together to provide DNS stripped of excessive advertising, trackers, malware and upstreaming your DNS requests, encrypted with tls to 
> CloudFlare's hidden .onion DNS resolver

## Usage


> To create the application there are just a few commands to do in your teminal:\
> `git clone https://github.com/sureserverman/nice-dns.git`\
> `cd nice-dns`\
> Of course you'll need git and docker to be installed on your machine
> If you want to install it with persistent data dirs, so that you could change your settings and they'll survive reboot then run:\
> `sudo docker compose -f persistent-settings-compose.yml up -d`
> 
> If you want to install it with web interface for pi-hole enabled, then run following command:\
> `sudo docker compose -f webinterface-compose.yml up -d`
> 
> But my favorite way is to install it without web interface and without persistent volumes. This is the most secure way. 
> For two reasons: No possibility for any sort of logs to survive reboots and no possible vulnerabilities in web interface. For this option you just run:\
> `sudo docker compose up -d`
> 
> To install it on Ubuntu with one-line command try to use:\
> `bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sureserverman/nice-dns/main/install-deb.sh)`
>
